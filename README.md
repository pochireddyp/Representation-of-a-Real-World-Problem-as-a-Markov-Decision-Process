# Representation-of-a-Real-World-Problem-as-a-Markov-Decision-Process


## Aim

To represent a real-world traffic signal control system as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) by defining its states, actions, transition probabilities, reward function, and implementing it using Python dictionaries.


---

## Problem Statement

### Problem Description

Consider a traffic signal control system at a road intersection. The traffic signal acts as an agent that decides whether to keep the current signal or switch it to reduce vehicle congestion and waiting time. The objective is to minimize traffic delays and maximize smooth traffic flow.


---

## MDP Components

A Markov Decision Process is represented as:

$$
MDP = (S, A, P, R, \gamma)
$$

Where:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $S$ | Set of states |
| $A$ | Set of actions |
| $P$ | Transition probability function |
| $R$ | Reward function |
| $\gamma$ | Discount factor |

---

## State Space


The state space should list all possible situations in which the agent can exist.

Example format:

```text
S = {
    Low Traffic,
    Medium Traffic,
    High Traffic
}
```



---

## Sample State

Write your answer here.

A sample state is one specific example from the state space.



---

## Action Space

Write your answer here.

The action space should list all possible actions available to the agent.

Example format:

```text
A = {
    Action 1,
    Action 2,
    Action 3,
    ...
}
```


---

## Sample Action

Write your answer here.

A sample action is one action selected from the action space.



---

## Transition Probability

Write your answer here.

The transition probability explains how the environment moves from one state to another after an action is taken.

General form:

$$
P(s' \mid s,a)
$$

This means:

> Probability of reaching next state $s'$ after taking action $a$ in current state $s$.


---

## Reward Function

Write your answer here.

The reward function defines the feedback received by the agent after taking an action.

General form:

$$
R(s,a,s')
$$



---

## Graphical Representation

Write your answer here.

Draw the MDP graph.

The graph should include:

1. States as nodes.
2. Actions as arrows.
3. Rewards on transitions.
4. Transition probabilities if applicable.


---

## Python Representation

Write your code here.

Use Python dictionaries to represent the MDP.


```python
# MDP Representation using Python
# print("Name:       ")
# print("Register Number:     ")

```
